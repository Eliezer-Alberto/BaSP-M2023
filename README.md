# BaSP-2023
## Week-02

The project consists on recreating on an html file, a **Landing Page** of a web site that was developed in the last week in a teamwork, using HTML precisely. 
 
 In order to make this task, a lot of related material was given about HTML, Git and Github; these last ones are tools that allow me to save code versions on a repository. Thanks to that, I can save my progress on the project and I also can share it with others users.
 
## Header

To begin with the presentation of the project, its body is made up of a header containing the name **MegaRocket** that appears as a logotype.


In the header, on the left side there is also a botton such as the one below.

It unfolds an **aside** section, that contains a Menu with some options to choose. Such as 
- Home 
- Sign Up 
- Log In 
- Info

and some contact information; *an email, a phone number and an address.*

## Main

The **Main** is divided into *sections.* The first one shows contents in a text format which is accompained by the following image.
