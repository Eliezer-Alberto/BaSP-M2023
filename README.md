# BaSP-2023
## Week-02

The project consists on recreating on an html file, a **Landing Page** of a web site that was developed in the last week in a teamwork, using HTML precisely. 
 
 In order to make this task, a lot of related material was given about HTML, Git and Github; these last ones are tools that allow me to save code versions on a repository. Thanks to that, I can save my progress on the project and I also can share it with others users.
 
## Header

To begin with the presentation of the project, its body is made up of a header containing the name **MegaRocket** that appears as a logotype.


In the header, on the left side there is also a botton such as the one below.

It unfolds an **aside** section, that contains a Menu with some options to choose. Such as 
- Home 
- Sign Up 
- Log In 
- Info

and some contact information; *an email, a phone number and an address.*

By the stage of the Week-06, the assignment consists on the following.

Using an empty requirements document, that was given by the tutors to each team. It was required to write there the necessary validations of inputs of the Login and Sign Up layouts for this week 06.

In order to solve the assignment of the week 06, it was taken the project folder done for the week 04 to paste it on a new folder, rename it to week-06 and from there make the activities of 6th problematic.

Following the same design and screenflow of the project on Figma that was made for the 1st week, now it is required to create these two layouts mentioned before and make all their validations from Java Script by manipulating the DOM.
